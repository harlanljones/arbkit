## Platform

web

## Stack

The core project is a Rust 2021 workspace. Its public results dashboard uses React, TypeScript, and Vite, ships as static assets on Cloudflare Workers, and deploys through Workers Builds to `https://arbkit.harlanljones.com/`.

## Users

The dashboard serves two audiences equally: public evaluators deciding whether the project is credible and engineers inspecting its methodology, performance, and reproducibility.

## Product Purpose

`arbkit` detects cross-venue sports and prediction-market arbitrage after accounting for fees, available depth, contract granularity, venue matching, and stale data. Success means producing pessimistic, reproducible paper-trading evidence while keeping the in-process hot path comfortably below its 50 microsecond p99 budget.

## Positioning

The project separates canonical market matching from a fixed-point, zero-allocation detection hot path, then subjects emitted signals to latency and queue-decay simulation instead of presenting raw theoretical edges as trades.

## Operating Context

Engineers run the release pipeline locally, review the console report and generated JSON snapshot, then commit approved dated results. Cloudflare Workers Builds publishes the static dashboard to `https://arbkit.harlanljones.com/` from repository history. The public deployment remains evidence-only; live order placement exists only as the opt-in, operator-authenticated console documented in `LIVE_TRADING.md`, and no venue credentials ship with the project.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Six Rust crates cover pricing and detection, matching, feeds, the engine, paper-trading simulation, and the opt-in execution boundary.
- Benchmark runs are host-specific and must carry environment and workload provenance.
- Dashboard results are generated, reviewed, and committed; there is no live upload API or Cloudflare data store.
- Synthetic workloads and paper-trading results must always be labeled as such; live records must carry authoritative order ids and settlement status.
- Different-host measurements may be compared, but must not be presented as same-machine performance trends.

## Brand Commitments

The name is `arbkit`. The voice is technically precise, skeptical of theoretical-only arbitrage claims, and explicit about pessimistic accounting, measurement boundaries, and limitations.

## Evidence on Hand

- `RESULTS.md` contains dated Apple Silicon and x86_64 Linux benchmark results, simulator accounting, and the 159-test verification matrix.
- `README.md` contains the project status, latency budget, performance highlights, live demo link, and scope limitations.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` documents the workspace, hot-path invariants, and end-to-end data flow.
- `crates/arbkit-engine/examples/pipeline.rs` is the executable source of generated benchmark and paper-trading metrics.
- Live public dashboard is available at `https://arbkit.harlanljones.com/`.
- No live-trading performance, customer claims, testimonials, or production order-placement evidence exists and none may be fabricated.

## Product Principles

- Prove performance with dated measurements and visible provenance.
- Distinguish theoretical signals from executable paper-trading outcomes.
- Prefer pessimistic, integer-based accounting over optimistic estimates.
- Let public readers understand the result quickly while keeping the methodology inspectable.
- Preserve the Rust hot path's dependency and allocation discipline.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

The dashboard must support keyboard navigation, reduced motion, responsive reading, sufficient contrast, and text/table equivalents for graphical evidence.
