The interactive proof ledger and benchmark results visualizer for the [`arbkit`](../README.md) Rust workspace.

> 🌐 **Production Deployment:** [https://arbkit.harlanljones.com/](https://arbkit.harlanljones.com/)

## Features

- **Audited Proof Ledger:** Visualizes the p99 latency against the 50 µs budget ruler with exact headroom calculation.
- **Latency Distribution Plot:** Tail percentiles (p50, p90, p99, p99.9, p99.99, max) across dated benchmark snapshots.
- **Host-to-Host Throughput:** High-frequency burst ingestion comparison across architectures (Apple Silicon and Linux x86_64).
- **Execution & Phantom Breakdown:** Proportional fills vs. queue-decayed phantom signals.
- **Pessimistic Financial Accounting:** Realized worst-case settlement PnL computed strictly in integer cents.
- **Workspace Verification Matrix:** Live pass/fail and clippy status across all workspace crates.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run local development server
npm run dev

# Run unit and component tests
npm test

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Build production bundle
npm run build
```

---

## Recording a Benchmark Snapshot

To execute the Rust release pipeline on the local machine, validate the resulting JSON report schema, and append a versioned snapshot to `public/data/runs/`:

```bash
npm run record
```

Review the updated `public/data/runs/index.json` and generated snapshot file before committing.

## Cloudflare Workers Deployment

The dashboard builds as a static Single Page Application (SPA) served via Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
# Dry run deploy
npm run deploy:dry

# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
npm run deploy
```

Configuration is defined in [`wrangler.jsonc`](wrangler.jsonc).

---

## Live Position Stream

Beyond the static proof ledger, the worker hosts a live paper-trading view:
`worker/index.ts` routes `/api/live/*` to the single `PositionRoom` Durable
Object, which owns all session arithmetic (totals, ROI bps floored toward
negative infinity, disposition funnel) and pushes authoritative frames to any
number of read-only WebSocket viewers.

- **Producer:** `cargo run -p arbkit-engine --example live_runner -- --url <ingest-url> --token-env ARBLIVE_TOKEN`
  streams detected-and-settled positions from the pipeline workload in fixed
  wall-clock windows (see the example's docs for flags).
- **Ingest auth:** `LIVE_INGEST_TOKEN` — set locally via `.dev.vars`
  (see [`.dev.vars.example`](.dev.vars.example)), in production via
  `wrangler secret put LIVE_INGEST_TOKEN`.
- **Viewer:** `wss://<host>/api/live/ws`, public and read-only; clients may
  send `{ "t": "resume", "afterSeq": N }` to replay missed ledger rows.
- **Staleness:** a session whose heartbeats stop for 20 s is marked stale by
  alarm and stays visible as such until its runner returns or a new session
  opens.
