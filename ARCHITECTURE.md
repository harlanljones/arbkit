## Executive Summary

`arbkit` is an ultra-low latency, deterministic cross-venue sports and prediction market arbitrage detection and paper-trading engine written in pure Rust.

The system ingests streaming order book snapshots and delta updates from exchanges (e.g., Kalshi, Polymarket CLOB) and aggregators, normalizes disparate quote formats and proposition representations, detects cross-venue mispricings in sub-microsecond time, and evaluates fill feasibility through an execution simulator accounting for queue front-running and asymmetric transit delays. Interactive benchmark distributions and proof ledgers can be explored live at [arbkit.harlanljones.com](https://arbkit.harlanljones.com/).

## 1. Workspace Architecture & Crate Responsibilities

The codebase is organized into six specialized crates enforcing strict separation of concerns and dependency isolation:

```
crates/arbkit-core     Prices, books, fees, detection. No I/O, no clock, no network.
crates/arbkit-match    Canonical event registry, team normalizer, string-to-ID interning.
crates/arbkit-feed     Polymarket and Kalshi parsers, binary tape recorder and player.
crates/arbkit-engine   Lock-free SPSC ring buffers, preallocated book slab, hot loop, latency histogram.
crates/arbkit-sim      Paper trading simulator, latency modeling, phantom-rate measurement.
crates/arbkit-exec     Risk-gated dry-run/live execution boundary and proof reports.
```

### Dependency Isolation Guarantees

| Crate | Primary Focus | Hot-Path Invariants | External Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`arbkit-core`](crates/arbkit-core) | Domain model, fixed-point prices, fee math, arb detector | **No I/O, no network, no clock, no allocations.** | `thiserror` only |
| [`arbkit-match`](crates/arbkit-match) | Canonical event/market registry, team aliases, line mirroring | Interns strings to `u32`/`u16` IDs before engine loop. | `arbkit-core`, `thiserror` |
| [`arbkit-feed`](crates/arbkit-feed) | Wire message parsing & zero-allocation binary tape | Stack-allocated `Copy` events (`FeedEvent`). | `arbkit-core`, `arbkit-match`, `serde`, `serde_json` |
| [`arbkit-engine`](crates/arbkit-engine) | Hot loop, SPSC ring, flat slab, latency histogram | **No locks, no allocations, single-threaded execution.** | `arbkit-core`, `arbkit-match`, `arbkit-feed`, `thiserror` |
| [`arbkit-sim`](crates/arbkit-sim) | Paper trading, queue front-running, phantom rate | Pure integer `Cents` accounting, zero floats in logic. | `arbkit-core`, `arbkit-match`, `arbkit-feed`, `arbkit-engine` |
| [`arbkit-exec`](crates/arbkit-exec) | Risk gate, hedge orchestration, live proof records | Downstream of the signal ring; never imported by the hot loop. | `arbkit-core`, `arbkit-match`, `serde`, optional `reqwest` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CI validates via `cargo tree` that `arbkit-core` never picks up an I/O crate (`tokio`, `reqwest`, `hyper`, `mio`, `socket2`, `tungstenite`). The core domain runs offline in milliseconds and is verified across 100% deterministic test suites.

## 2. Core Mathematical & Domain Innovations

### A. Fixed-Point Integer Pricing (`Prob` & `Odds`)
Textbook arbitrage formulas evaluate whether $\sum \frac{1}{\text{odds}_i} < 1.0$. Performing this in standard `f64` floating-point arithmetic is vulnerable to non-associativity and precision drift that manufactures non-existent edges.

- `Prob`: Implied probability in **parts per million (ppm)** stored as `u32` ($\text{ppm} \in [1, 1\,000\,000]$).
- `Odds`: Micro-unit decimal odds stored as `u64` ($\text{micro} \in [1\,000\,000, 1\,000\,000\,000\,000]$).
- Exact integer reciprocal relationship: $\text{ppm} \times \text{micro} \approx 10^{12}$ with zero-bias rounded division (`div_round`).

### B. Pre-Comparison Venue Fee Adjustments
Raw-quote detectors generate streams dominated by false edges. Fees must be applied to each leg *before* the overround summation:

1. **Exchange Net Winnings Commission** (Betfair model): $\text{Odds}_{\text{eff}} = 1 + (d - 1)(1 - c)$
2. **Stake Fee Model**: $\text{Odds}_{\text{eff}} = \frac{d}{1 + f}$
3. **Kalshi Per-Contract Model**: $\text{Fee} = \lceil 0.07 \times C \times P \times (1 - P) \rceil$, which reduces to $700 \times (1 - P)\text{ bps}$ of stake. This peaks at $350\text{ bps}$ for $50¢$ contracts and penalizes low-probability contracts even more heavily.

### C. Pessimistic Sizing & Payoff Equalization
- **Depth Capping**: Sized against the thinnest leg's resting liquidity.
- **Granularity Truncation**: Each leg's stake is rounded down to integer contract increments (`increment`).
- **Guaranteed Profit Floor**: Reported profit is the **worst-case payout across any outcome** minus the total stake:
$$\text{Worst-Case Profit} = \min_{i} (\text{Payout}_i) - \sum_{j} \text{Stake}_j$$

### D. Staleness as a First-Class Safety State
When a feed skips a sequence number, `OutcomeBook` immediately transitions to `stale = true` and suppresses quote emissions. Gaps degrade into silence rather than confidently incorrect trades.

## 3. Hot-Path Low-Latency Engineering

The hot loop (`crates/arbkit-engine`) is engineered to satisfy a **$p99 < 50\text{ }\mu\text{s}$** latency budget:

1. **Zero Heap Allocation**:
   - Fixed-size arrays throughout (`[Level; 8]`, `[Leg; 4]`, `[Allocation; 4]`).
   - `EngineSlab` preallocates all books in a flat vector indexed via arithmetic:
     $$\text{Index} = (\text{market\_id} \times \text{MAX\_OUTCOMES} + \text{outcome\_id}) \times \text{MAX\_VENUES} + \text{venue\_id}$$
2. **Lock-Free SPSC Queues**:
   - Zero-allocation turn-sequenced atomic ring buffers with acquire-release memory ordering.
   - Slots and pointers are aligned to 64 bytes (`#[repr(align(64))]`) to eliminate CPU cacheline bouncing and false sharing.
3. **Synchronous Pinned Loop**:
   - The hot engine loop executes on a dedicated OS thread without async runtimes (`tokio` terminates at the feed edge).

## Opt-in live execution boundary

`arbkit-feed`'s `live` feature contains Tokio WebSocket connectors and a
bridge into the synchronous feed ring. `arbkit-exec` consumes emitted signals
after they leave the ring. Its `RiskGate` reserves per-venue capital before
submission, `HedgedExecutor` requires both legs to fill, and partial hedges are
unwound and reported as live phantoms. The default CLI mode is dry-run and the
kill switch is enabled unless `ARBKIT_KILL_SWITCH=0` is explicitly supplied.
Credentials belong only in environment variables or an external secret
manager; they are never committed.
